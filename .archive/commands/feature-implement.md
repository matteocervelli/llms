description: LEGACY VERSION - Original 183-line feature-implement command (replaced by 15-line version)

# LEGACY: Implement Feature from Issue #$1

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is the original 183-line version, preserved for reference and comparison.**
**‚úÖ Current version: `feature-implement.md` (15 lines, delegates to feature-implementer agent)**

---

## Parameter Validation

```bash
# Validate required parameters
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Error: Issue number is required"
  echo "Usage: /feature <issue-number> [create-branch:true|false]"
  exit 1
fi

ISSUE_NUMBER="$1"
CREATE_BRANCH="${2:-true}"
```

## Analysis Phase

```bash
!gh issue view $1

# Conditionally create feature branch
if [ "$CREATE_BRANCH" = "true" ]; then
  !git checkout -b feature/$1
else
  echo "Skipping branch creation (CREATE_BRANCH=$CREATE_BRANCH)"
fi
```

Use sequential-thinking-mcp to:

1. Analyze requirements and acceptance criteria
2. Design solution with security considerations (auth, input validation, data protection)
3. Plan performance targets (response times, resource usage)
4. Define layered architecture (interfaces ‚Üí core ‚Üí implementations)

When understood the implementation plan, get the tech stack from @docs/TECH-STACK.md.
Then, use context7 to fetch latest documentation for required tools for the specific feature, also considering the tech stack from @docs/TECH-STACK.md

## Design Phase

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Create a complete design plan before implementation. Do NOT start coding until this plan is reviewed and approved by the user.**

**üí° Tip**: For safer planning, users can activate Plan Mode (press Shift+Tab twice) before running this command.

Use sequential-thinking-mcp with extended thinking to create a comprehensive design:

Create component design following:

- **Security-by-design**: Input validation, authentication flows, data encryption
- **Performance-first**: Caching strategy, query optimization, resource management
- **Modularity**: Keep components under 500 lines, clear separation of concerns

Your design document should include:

1. **Architecture Overview**: Components, layers, and their dependencies
2. **Data Flow**: How data moves through the system
3. **Security Measures**: Authentication, authorization, input validation strategies
4. **Performance Strategy**: Caching mechanisms, optimization approaches, scaling considerations
5. **Testing Approach**: Unit test strategy, integration test coverage, security test scenarios
6. **Implementation Steps**: Ordered list of concrete development tasks

Document architecture decision in `docs/architecture/ADR/` for architectural decisions

### User Confirmation Required

After presenting the complete design, explicitly ask the user: "Should I proceed with implementation based on this design?"

## Model Switch

**Switching to Haiku model for efficient implementation.**

Use the faster Haiku model for the implementation phase to optimize for speed and cost while maintaining quality for code generation tasks.

## Implementation Phase

Implement following layered pattern:

1. Interface layer: Type definitions and contracts
2. Core layer: Business logic with security validation
3. Implementation layer: Data access and external services

**Security measures**:

- Validate all inputs at entry points
- Sanitize outputs to prevent XSS
- Use parameterized queries for database access
- Implement proper authentication/authorization

**Performance optimizations**:

- Add caching where appropriate
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Implement async/await correctly
- Add rate limiting if needed

## Testing Phase

```bash
# Quality checks
!npm run lint && npm run typecheck || flake8 . && mypy .
!npm run test || pytest
!npm run build
```

Create comprehensive tests:

- **Unit tests**: 80%+ coverage, test business logic and edge cases
- **Integration tests**: API endpoints, database interactions
- **Security tests**: Input validation, authentication, authorization
- **Performance tests**: Response times, load testing if needed

## Validation Checkpoint

Test the feature in development and confirm:

1. All acceptance criteria met
2. Security measures working (auth, validation, no data leaks)
3. Performance within targets (response times, resource usage)
4. Integration with existing features smooth

## Documentation Phase

Update documentation:

- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger) for new endpoints
- `docs/implementation/` with feature implementation details
- `docs/guides/` with user guide for the feature
- `docs/architecture/sequence-diagrams/` for complex flows

## Deploy Phase

```bash
# Commit and push changes
if [ "$CREATE_BRANCH" = "true" ]; then
  BRANCH_NAME="feature/$1"
else
  BRANCH_NAME=$(git branch --show-current)
fi

!git add . && git commit -m "feat: implement issue #$1

- Implementation: [brief description of solution]
- Security: [auth requirements, input validation, data protection]
- Performance: [caching, optimization, response times]
- Testing: [coverage %, integration tests, security tests]

Features:
- [list key capabilities]

Closes #$1"

!git push origin $BRANCH_NAME

!gh pr create --title "feat: implement issue #$1" --body "
