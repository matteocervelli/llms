# Frontend Design Skill

## Overview

This orchestrator skill composes five design dimensions with tech-specific implementations to create distinctive, production-grade frontends that avoid generic AI design patterns.

**The 5 Dimensions**:

1. **Typography** – Typeface selection, font pairings, weights, sizing, and hierarchy
2. **Color & Theme** – Emotional intent, color systems, and unexpected accents
3. **Motion** – Orchestrated animations, easing, and interaction choreography
4. **Spatial Composition** – Layout, spacing systems, and asymmetrical design
5. **Backgrounds & Details** – Subtle textures, gradients, and visual rewards

**Tech Implementations** (choose one):

- React with Vite and Framer Motion
- Vue (Options API or Composition API)
- Svelte with custom animations
- HTML/CSS/SCSS fundamentals
- Design system integrations (Tailwind, shadcn/ui, Radix, Material)

**Motion & animations**

## 8-Phase Workflow

1. **Design Thinking** – Answer purpose, tone, constraints, differentiation
2. **Typography** – Select typefaces, weights, sizes, hierarchy
3. **Color & Theme** – Define emotional intent, color system, accents
4. **Motion** – Plan animations, easing, interaction sequences
5. **Spatial Composition** – Design layouts, spacing scales, asymmetry
6. **Backgrounds & Details** – Add subtle textures, gradients, micro-details
7. **Implementation** – Follow your tech-specific sub-skill
8. **Validation** – Design review, accessibility, performance, mobile

## Anti-Patterns (Reject These)

**Typography**

- ❌ Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, system fonts
- ❌ Mid-range weights only (400, 500, 600)
- ❌ Incremental size scaling (48px → 40px → 32px)

**Color**

- ❌ Material Design trinity (Blue, Red, Green)
- ❌ Pure grays without personality (#999, #CCC)
- ❌ Oversaturated neon accents

**Layout**

- ❌ Everything centered (predictable, boring)
- ❌ Uniform padding everywhere
- ❌ "Default SaaS dashboard" aesthetic

**Motion**

- ❌ Linear timing on everything
- ❌ No animation at all
- ❌ Slow, sluggish transitions (2s+)
