## Common Requirement Issues

### Ambiguous Language to Avoid
- [ ] "Fast", "quick", "responsive" without metrics
- [ ] "User-friendly", "intuitive", "easy" without criteria
- [ ] "Robust", "reliable", "stable" without measures
- [ ] "Secure" without specific security requirements
- [ ] "Scalable" without growth metrics
- [ ] "Flexible", "extensible" without specifics
- [ ] "As soon as possible", "eventually" without timelines
- [ ] "Maximize", "minimize", "optimize" without targets

### Missing Information Flags
- [ ] No error handling specified
- [ ] No validation rules defined
- [ ] No performance targets set
- [ ] No security considerations mentioned
- [ ] No data migration plan
- [ ] No backward compatibility strategy
- [ ] No rollback procedure
- [ ] No monitoring/alerting requirements

### Conflicting Requirements Patterns
- [ ] Real-time updates vs. batch processing
- [ ] High availability vs. low infrastructure cost
- [ ] Feature richness vs. simplicity
- [ ] Strict security vs. ease of use
- [ ] Performance vs. comprehensive logging
- [ ] Flexibility vs. standardization

## Validation Questions

### For Each Requirement, Ask:
1. **What**: What exactly needs to be built?
2. **Why**: Why is this needed? What problem does it solve?
3. **Who**: Who will use this? Who benefits?
4. **When**: When is this needed? What's the deadline?
5. **Where**: Where does this fit in the system?
6. **How**: How will we know it's done? How will we test it?

### Red Flags
- [ ] Requirement starts with "The system should be able to..."
- [ ] Multiple "and"s in single requirement (decompose it)
- [ ] Contains "etc.", "and so on", "similar" (incomplete)
- [ ] Uses "always", "never", "all" (absolutist)
- [ ] Mixes functional and non-functional aspects
- [ ] Implementation details instead of requirements
- [ ] Solution-focused instead of problem-focused

## Prioritization Validation

### MoSCoW Criteria
- **Must Have (P0)**:
  - [ ] Critical for MVP
  - [ ] System unusable without it
  - [ ] Legal/regulatory requirement
  - [ ] High business value + high urgency

- **Should Have (P1)**:
  - [ ] Important but not critical
  - [ ] Has workarounds
  - [ ] High business value + lower urgency
  - [ ] Included if time/budget allows

- **Could Have (P2)**:
  - [ ] Desirable but optional
  - [ ] Nice-to-have features
  - [ ] Low effort + medium value
  - [ ] Can be deferred without impact

- **Won't Have (P3)**:
  - [ ] Out of scope for this release
  - [ ] Future enhancement
  - [ ] Low priority + high effort
  - [ ] Explicitly excluded

## Documentation Standards

- [ ] Each requirement has unique identifier (FR-XXX, NFR-XXX)
- [ ] Requirements are numbered sequentially
- [ ] Requirements are grouped by category
- [ ] Cross-references use requirement IDs
- [ ] Change history is tracked
- [ ] Source/rationale is documented
- [ ] Owner/stakeholder is identified
- [ ] Creation date is recorded

## Final Validation

Before finalizing requirements:
- [ ] All checkboxes above are completed
- [ ] Stakeholders have reviewed
- [ ] Ambiguities have been resolved
- [ ] Conflicts have been resolved
- [ ] Priorities have been agreed upon
- [ ] Scope is clearly defined
- [ ] Risks have been identified
- [ ] Dependencies have been confirmed
- [ ] Timeline is realistic
- [ ] Team capacity is adequate
