When user enters correct credentials
Then user is redirected to dashboard
And session token is created
```

**Extraction**:
- **AC-004**: Valid credentials redirect to dashboard
- **AC-005**: Session token creation on successful login

### Pattern 3: Scenario Format
**Format**: Scenario description with steps

**Example**:
```
Scenario: Successful Password Reset
1. User clicks "Forgot Password"
2. User enters email address
3. System sends reset link
4. User clicks link and enters new password
5. User can log in with new password
```

**Extraction**:
- **AC-006**: Forgot password workflow
- **AC-007**: Reset link email sent
- **AC-008**: Password update via link
- **AC-009**: Login with new password

### Pattern 4: Definition of Done
**Keywords**: "Done when...", "Complete when...", "Success criteria:"

- Code reviewed and merged
```

**Extraction**:
- **AC-010**: Feature implementation complete
- **AC-011**: 80%+ test coverage achieved
- **AC-012**: Documentation updated
- **AC-013**: Code review approved and merged

## User Story Patterns

### Pattern 1: Standard Format
**Format**: As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

**Example**:
```
As a registered user, I want to export my data to CSV, so that I can analyze it offline.
```

**Extraction**:
- **Role**: Registered user
- **Feature**: Data export to CSV
- **Benefit**: Offline analysis
- **Priority**: (Determine from context)

### Pattern 2: Job Story Format
**Format**: When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]

**Example**:
```
When I receive a notification, I want to click to view details, so I can respond quickly.
```

**Extraction**:
- **Situation**: Notification received
- **Motivation**: View details
- **Outcome**: Quick response
- **Priority**: (Determine from context)

### Pattern 3: Feature Request Format
**Keywords**: "I would like...", "It would be great if...", "Please add..."

**Example**:
```
It would be great if users could schedule posts for future publication.
```

**Extraction**:
- **Role**: Content creator/user
- **Feature**: Scheduled post publication
- **Benefit**: Time management, automation
- **Priority**: Could Have (unless stated otherwise)

## Issue Body Structure Patterns

### Pattern 1: Templated Issues
**Common Sections**:
- Description/Overview
- Expected Behavior
- Current Behavior
- Steps to Reproduce
- Acceptance Criteria
- Additional Context

**Extraction Strategy**:
- Description → Business requirement
- Expected Behavior → Functional requirements
- Acceptance Criteria → Test criteria
- Additional Context → Constraints, dependencies

### Pattern 2: Epic Issues
**Structure**: Multiple related features under one umbrella

**Example**:
```
Epic: User Management System

Features:
- User registration
- User authentication
- Password reset
- Profile management
- Role-based access control
```

**Extraction**:
- Break into individual features
- Each feature becomes user story
- Epic provides overall context

### Pattern 3: Bug Reports
**Structure**: Issue describes problem to fix

**Example**:
```
Bug: Login fails with valid credentials

Steps: 1. Enter valid email, 2. Enter correct password, 3. Click login
Expected: User logged in
Actual: "Invalid credentials" error shown
```

**Extraction**:
- Expected behavior → Functional requirement
- Current behavior → Defect to fix
- Fix acceptance criteria → Test cases

## Priority Indicators

### Must Have Indicators
**Keywords**: "critical", "required", "must", "blocking", "essential", "mandatory"

**Labels**: `priority:critical`, `P0`, `blocker`

### Should Have Indicators
**Keywords**: "important", "should", "needed", "significant"

**Labels**: `priority:high`, `P1`

### Could Have Indicators
**Keywords**: "nice to have", "could", "optional", "desirable", "enhancement"

**Labels**: `priority:medium`, `P2`, `enhancement`

### Won't Have Indicators
**Keywords**: "future", "later", "out of scope", "won't", "deferred"

**Labels**: `wontfix`, `future`, `backlog`

## Constraint Patterns

### Time Constraints
- "Must be completed by [date]"
- "Deadline: [date]"
- "Time-sensitive"

### Resource Constraints
- "Using only existing libraries"
- "Without adding dependencies"
- "Within current infrastructure"

### Technical Constraints
- "Must work on [platform/browser]"
- "Compatible with [technology]"
- "Using [specific technology/framework]"

### Business Constraints
- "Within budget of [amount]"
- "Compliant with [regulation]"
- "Aligned with [business goal]"

## Dependency Patterns

### Explicit Dependencies
- "Depends on #[issue-number]"
- "Blocked by [feature/issue]"
- "Requires [component/library]"

### Implicit Dependencies
- "After user authentication is implemented..."
- "Once the database is migrated..."
- "When the API is available..."

## Extraction Workflow

### Step 1: Identify Pattern
- Scan issue for keywords
- Recognize structure (template, user story, bug report)
- Note sections and headings

### Step 2: Extract Content
- Apply relevant patterns
- Capture exact wording
- Note context and relationships

### Step 3: Categorize
- Functional vs. Non-functional
- Priority level
- Category (performance, security, usability, etc.)

### Step 4: Structure
- Assign unique IDs
- Format consistently
- Link related requirements

### Step 5: Validate
- Check against requirements-checklist.md
- Ensure completeness
- Verify testability

## Common Pitfalls

### Avoid These Extractions
- **Implementation details as requirements**
  - Bad: "Use React hooks for state management"
  - Good: "Maintain application state across components"

- **Solution instead of problem**
  - Bad: "Add a caching layer"
  - Good: "Reduce API response time to <200ms"

- **Vague statements**
  - Bad: "System should be fast"
  - Good: "95th percentile response time <500ms"
