# CHANGELOG Generator Skill

## Purpose

This skill provides systematic guidance for generating CHANGELOG entries that follow conventional commits format and semantic versioning principles, ensuring clear and consistent change history documentation.

## When to Use

- After feature implementation and documentation updates
- Need to document changes for users and developers
- Following conventional commits format
- Determining semantic version increments
- Creating release notes

## CHANGELOG Generation Workflow

### 1. Analyze Changes

**Objective**: Understand what changed in this feature/fix.

**Review commit history**:
```bash
# View commits since last release/main
git log --oneline main..HEAD

# View detailed commits
git log main..HEAD

# View files changed
git diff --stat main..HEAD

# View actual changes
git diff main..HEAD
```

**Identify change types**:
- New features added
- Bug fixes implemented
- Documentation updates
- Performance improvements
- Security enhancements
- Breaking changes
- Deprecations

**Review issue and PR**:
- Read original issue description
- Review acceptance criteria
- Check PR description
- Note any breaking changes
- Identify security implications

**Deliverable**: Clear understanding of all changes

---

### 2. Determine Change Type

**Objective**: Classify the change according to conventional commits.

**Conventional Commit Types**:

| Type | Description | Version Impact | Use When |
|------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| `feat` | New feature | MINOR (0.X.0) | Adding new functionality |
| `fix` | Bug fix | PATCH (0.0.X) | Fixing a bug |
| `docs` | Documentation | PATCH (0.0.X) | Only docs changed |
| `style` | Code style | PATCH (0.0.X) | Formatting, whitespace |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring | PATCH (0.0.X) | Code restructure, no behavior change |
| `perf` | Performance | PATCH (0.0.X) | Performance improvements |
| `test` | Tests | PATCH (0.0.X) | Adding/updating tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance | PATCH (0.0.X) | Build, deps, configs |
| `BREAKING CHANGE` | Breaking change | MAJOR (X.0.0) | Incompatible API changes |

**Decision Tree**:
```
Does it add new functionality?
  └─ Yes → `feat` (MINOR bump)
  └─ No  → Does it fix a bug?
      └─ Yes → `fix` (PATCH bump)
      └─ No  → Is it a breaking change?
          └─ Yes → `BREAKING CHANGE` (MAJOR bump)
          └─ No  → Choose appropriate type (PATCH bump)
```

**Breaking Changes**:
A breaking change occurs when:
- Public API signature changes
- Required parameters added
- Return types changed
- Behavior changes in incompatible way
- Configuration format changes
- Removal of features

**Examples**:
```markdown
feat: add user authentication system (#123)
fix: resolve memory leak in cache manager (#124)
docs: update API documentation for v2.0 (#125)
refactor: simplify database connection logic (#126)
perf: optimize query performance with indexing (#127)
BREAKING CHANGE: change authentication API (#128)
```

**Deliverable**: Identified change type and version impact

---

### 3. Calculate Semantic Version

**Objective**: Determine the next version number.

**Semantic Versioning Format**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

**Version Increment Rules**:
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, incompatible API
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, backward compatible

**Read current version**:
```bash
# From CHANGELOG.md
head -20 CHANGELOG.md

# From pyproject.toml (Python)
grep "^version" pyproject.toml

# From package.json (Node.js)
grep '"version"' package.json

# From __init__.py (Python)
grep "__version__" src/__init__.py
```

**Calculate next version**:
```python
# Example calculation
current = "1.2.3"  # Current version

# For MAJOR bump (breaking change)
next = "2.0.0"

# For MINOR bump (new feature)
next = "1.3.0"

# For PATCH bump (bug fix)
next = "1.2.4"
```

**Pre-release versions**:
```
1.0.0-alpha.1  # Alpha release
1.0.0-beta.1   # Beta release
1.0.0-rc.1     # Release candidate
```

**Deliverable**: Next version number

---

### 4. Generate CHANGELOG Entry

**Objective**: Create properly formatted CHANGELOG entry.

**Read existing CHANGELOG**:
```bash
# Read CHANGELOG to understand format
Read CHANGELOG.md
```

**CHANGELOG Format** (Keep a Changelog):
```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
