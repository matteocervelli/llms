# Security Assessment Checklist

Comprehensive OWASP Top 10 security assessment checklist with Python-specific considerations.

## OWASP Top 10 (2021) Assessment

### 1. Broken Access Control

**Risk Description**: Users can act outside their intended permissions, accessing unauthorized functions or data.

**Assessment Questions**:
- [ ] Are there different user roles or permission levels?
- [ ] Does feature involve accessing resources owned by other users?
- [ ] Can users modify URLs/parameters to access unauthorized data?
- [ ] Are API endpoints protected with proper authorization checks?
- [ ] Is authorization checked on every request (not just on entry)?
- [ ] Are insecure direct object references (IDOR) prevented?
- [ ] Is privilege escalation possible?
- [ ] Are CORS policies properly configured?

**Python-Specific Checks**:
- [ ] Using decorators for permission checks (@requires_permission)?
- [ ] Checking authorization in views/handlers, not just templates?
- [ ] Using Django/Flask permissions frameworks correctly?
- [ ] Implementing resource-level permissions, not just view-level?

**Risk Level**: [None | Low | Medium | High | Critical]

**Mitigations**:
- Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) or ABAC (Attribute-Based)

- Use indirect references (UUIDs instead of sequential IDs)
- Deny by default (whitelist approach)
- Log authorization failures
- Implement resource-level authorization
- Use framework-provided authorization mechanisms

## Python-Specific Security Best Practices

### Password Hashing
```python
# Good: bcrypt
import bcrypt
hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode(), bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12))

# Good: Argon2
from argon2 import PasswordHasher
ph = PasswordHasher()
hashed = ph.hash(password)

# Bad: MD5/SHA1/SHA256 (not designed for passwords)
```

### Secure Random
```python
# Good: secrets module
import secrets
token = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)

# Bad: random module (predictable)
```

### SQL Injection Prevention
```python
# Good: Parameterized query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?", (email,))

# Good: ORM
User.objects.filter(email=email)

# Bad: String formatting
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '{email}'")
```

### Command Injection Prevention
```python
# Good: Use library functions
import shutil
shutil.copy(src, dst)

# Bad: Shell commands
os.system(f"cp {src} {dst}")
```

### Serialization
```python
# Good: JSON
import json
data = json.loads(user_input)

# Bad: Pickle (arbitrary code execution)
import pickle
data = pickle.loads(user_input)
```
