## Usage Guide

### Step 1: Understand Feature Context

Read the requirements to understand:
- What data is being processed?
- Who will access this feature?
- What external systems are involved?
- What sensitive operations are performed?
- What user input is accepted?

### Step 2: OWASP Top 10 Assessment

Use `security-checklist.md` to systematically evaluate each risk:

#### 1. Broken Access Control
**Check for**:
- Are there different user roles?
- Is there privileged functionality?
- Can users access resources they shouldn't?
- Are file paths/URLs user-controllable?

**Assessment Questions**:
- [ ] Does feature involve authorization checks?
- [ ] Are there admin-only operations?
- [ ] Can users modify URLs to access others' data?
- [ ] Are API endpoints properly protected?

**Risk Level**: [None | Low | Medium | High | Critical]

**Mitigation**:
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use permission checks on every request
- Implement resource-level authorization
- Use indirect references (avoid exposing IDs)

#### 2. Cryptographic Failures
**Check for**:
- Is sensitive data transmitted?
- Is sensitive data stored?
- Are passwords handled?
- Are API keys/tokens used?

**Assessment Questions**:
- [ ] Is data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3+)?
- [ ] Is sensitive data encrypted at rest?
- [ ] Are passwords hashed with strong algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)?
- [ ] Are API keys/secrets properly secured?

**Risk Level**: [None | Low | Medium | High | Critical]

**Mitigation**:
- Enforce TLS 1.3+ for all connections
- Use AES-256 for data at rest
- Use bcrypt (cost ≥12) or Argon2 for passwords
- Store secrets in environment variables or vaults
- Never log sensitive data

#### 3. Injection
**Check for**:
- Does feature accept user input?
- Is input used in SQL queries?
- Is input used in shell commands?
- Is input used in dynamic code evaluation?

**Assessment Questions**:
- [ ] Is user input validated and sanitized?
- [ ] Are parameterized queries used for SQL?
- [ ] Are shell commands avoided or properly escaped?
- [ ] Is eval() or similar avoided?

**Risk Level**: [None | Low | Medium | High | Critical]

**Mitigation**:
- Use parameterized queries (never string concatenation)
- Validate all input (whitelist approach)
- Use ORM/query builders with parameter binding
- Avoid shell commands; use library functions instead
- Never use eval() or exec() with user input

#### 4. Insecure Design
**Check for**:

- Secure CI/CD pipeline
- Avoid deserializing untrusted data
- Use safe serialization formats (JSON over pickle)
- Implement code signing

#### 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

### Step 4: Threat Modeling

Use `threat-modeling-guide.md` to systematically identify threats:

#### Assets

- Business logic
- Infrastructure

#### Threat Actors
- External attackers
- Malicious users
- Insider threats
- Automated bots

#### Attack Vectors
- Web application
- API endpoints
- Database
- File system
- Network

#### STRIDE Analysis
- **Spoofing**: Can attacker impersonate users?
- **Tampering**: Can attacker modify data?
- **Repudiation**: Can actions be denied?
- **Information Disclosure**: Can sensitive data leak?
- **Denial of Service**: Can system be made unavailable?
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Can attacker gain higher privileges?

### Step 5: Security Testing Strategy

Define testing approach:

```markdown
## Security Testing Strategy

## Security Assessment

### OWASP Top 10 Risks

1. **Broken Access Control**: LOW
   - Feature implements authentication (positive control)
   - Need to ensure session validation on all protected endpoints

2. **Cryptographic Failures**: MEDIUM
   - Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt (cost ≥12)
   - TLS required for credential transmission
   - Session tokens must be cryptographically secure

3. **Injection**: LOW
   - Email input must be validated
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations

7. **Identification and Authentication Failures**: HIGH
   - Primary authentication feature - critical risk
   - Requires strong password policy
   - Needs brute-force protection
