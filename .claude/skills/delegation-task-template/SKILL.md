### 5. Optional: GitHub Integration

If the user wants to create a GitHub issue, provide the content formatted for GitHub:
- Use GitHub-flavored markdown
- Include labels (enhancement, bug, documentation, etc.)
- Add milestone and project information
- Suggest assignees

## Tool Usage Guidelines

### Read
- **Use for**: Reading existing task templates, project documentation, or related files
- **Example**: `Read previous delegation tasks to maintain consistency`

### Write
- **Use for**: Creating new delegation task documents, checklists, or supporting files
- **Example**: `Write the main task document to TASK-feature-xyz-2025-10-30.md`

### Edit
- **Use for**: Updating existing tasks, adding progress notes, or refining requirements
- **Example**: `Edit task document to add new acceptance criteria`

### TodoWrite
- **Use for**: Breaking down the delegation task into trackable todos for immediate execution
- **Example**: `Create todos for gathering requirements, drafting task, and saving document`

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development Task

**User Request**: "Create a delegation task for implementing user authentication"

**Generated Task**:
- Title: "Implement User Authentication System"
- Context: OAuth2 integration, JWT tokens, role-based access
- DoD: Login/logout working, tests passing, docs updated
- Checklist: 15+ specific steps
- Due date: 2 weeks
- Success metrics: < 500ms response time, 90%+ test coverage

### Example 2: Bug Fix Task

**User Request**: "Create a task to fix the payment processing timeout issue"

**Generated Task**:
- Title: "Fix Payment Processing Timeout (Issue #234)"
- Context: Users reporting timeouts after 30 seconds, impacts checkout
- DoD: Timeout resolved, no errors in logs, monitoring alerts cleared

- DoD: All endpoints documented, examples provided, published to docs site
- Checklist: List endpoints, write descriptions, add examples, review, publish
- Resources: OpenAPI spec, Postman collection, existing docs

### Example 4: Team Delegation

**User Request**: "Create a task for Sarah to migrate the database schema"

**Generated Task**:
- Title: "Migrate Database Schema to v2.0"
- Assignee: Sarah Johnson (sarah@company.com)
- Context: New schema required for multi-tenancy feature
- DoD: Migration script tested, data integrity verified, rollback plan ready
- Dependencies: Design approval from architecture team
- Timeline: 5-day timeline with milestones

## Best Practices

### Task Creation
- **Be Specific**: Avoid vague requirements; use concrete, measurable criteria
- **Provide Context**: Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- **Break It Down**: Complex tasks need detailed step-by-step checklists
- **Set Realistic Deadlines**: Consider complexity and dependencies
- **Define Success**: Include both quantitative and qualitative metrics

### Communication
- **Clear Language**: Use simple, direct language; avoid jargon unless necessary
- **Visual Clarity**: Use emojis, headers, and formatting for readability
- **Complete Information**: Include all resources, links, and contacts upfront
- **Update Regularly**: Keep progress notes current for transparency

### Collaboration
- **Identify Dependencies**: Call out blockers and dependencies explicitly
- **Provide Resources**: Link to all relevant documentation and references
- **Enable Questions**: Make it easy for assignees to ask for clarification
- **Track Progress**: Use status indicators and timeline updates

### Quality Assurance
- **Review Criteria**: Ensure acceptance criteria are verifiable
- **Test Requirements**: Include testing expectations in the checklist
- **Documentation**: Require documentation updates as part of DoD
- **Feedback Loop**: Plan for review and iteration

## Integration with Claude SDK

This skill can be integrated into applications using the Claude SDK:

```python
# Example: Using this skill in a Claude SDK application

from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic(api_key="your-api-key")

# Request task creation
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=4000,
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": """Use the delegation-task-template skill to create a task for:
        - Title: Implement dark mode feature
        - Assignee: John Doe
        - Due date: 2025-11-15
        - Priority: Medium
        - Context: Users requesting dark mode for better UX
        """
    }]
)

# The response will contain a complete delegation task document
task_content = response.content[0].text

# Save to your task management system
save_to_project_management_tool(task_content)
```

## Output Formats

This skill can generate tasks in multiple formats:

### Markdown (Default)
- Portable, readable, version-controllable
- Works with GitHub, GitLab, Notion, etc.

### JSON (Programmatic)
```json
{
  "title": "Task Title",
  "assignee": "Name",
  "due_date": "2025-11-15",
  "priority": "high",
  "context": "...",
  "definition_of_done": [...],
  "acceptance_criteria": [...],
  "checklist": [...]
}
```

### GitHub Issue Template
- Formatted for GitHub issues
- Includes labels, milestones, projects

### Notion Database Entry
- Formatted for Notion import
- Properties and relations included

## Error Handling

### Common Issues

**Missing Information**:
- Ask user for required fields (title, assignee, due date)
- Provide sensible defaults where appropriate
- Suggest common priorities and timelines

**Unclear Requirements**:
- Ask clarifying questions before generating task
- Provide examples of well-defined vs. vague requirements
- Iterate on task definition with user feedback

**Integration Failures**:
- Provide task content even if external system integration fails
- Offer alternative formats (copy-paste, download, etc.)
- Log errors for debugging

## Tips for Effective Delegation

1. **Set Clear Expectations**: Don't assume knowledge; be explicit
2. **Provide Autonomy**: Give the "what" and "why", let them decide "how"
3. **Include Learning Resources**: Help assignees learn, don't just instruct
4. **Build in Checkpoints**: Regular check-ins prevent late surprises
5. **Celebrate Success**: Include recognition in task completion workflow
