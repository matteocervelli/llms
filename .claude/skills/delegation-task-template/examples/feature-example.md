**Additional Context:**

This is a high-visibility feature with executive sponsorship. The CEO mentioned it in the last all-hands as a Q4 priority. We have 2 weeks to deliver, which is tight but achievable if we stay focused and avoid scope creep.

The design team spent 3 months researching and designing this feature, so the designs are solid. Stick to the specs unless you find a significant technical blocker.

Beta testing will start immediately after QA approval with our power user cohort (500 users). We'll monitor feedback closely and make quick fixes if needed before full rollout.

Good luck! This is an exciting feature that will make a real difference for our users.
