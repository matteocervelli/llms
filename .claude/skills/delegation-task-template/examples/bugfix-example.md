# Fix Payment Processing Timeout Issue

**Status**: üî¥ Urgent
**Assignee**: DevOps Team (devops@company.com)
**Due Date**: 2025-11-01 (2 days)
**Priority**: Critical
**Created**: 2025-10-30

## üìã Task Summary

Critical bug causing payment processing to timeout after 30 seconds, resulting in failed transactions and customer complaints. This affects approximately 15% of transactions during peak hours and is causing significant revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction.

---

## üéØ Context & Background

**Why this task is urgent:**
- 150+ customer complaints in last 24 hours
- Estimated $50K/day revenue loss
- Payment success rate dropped from 98% to 85%
- Issue started 2025-10-29 after payment gateway upgrade

**Business impact:**
- Direct revenue loss
- Customer trust and satisfaction declining
- Support team overwhelmed (ticket volume up 300%)
- Risk of customers switching to competitors

**Technical context:**
- Payment gateway upgraded from v2.1 to v3.0 on 2025-10-29
- Timeout occurs during the payment confirmation phase
- No changes to our payment processing code
- Issue only affects credit card payments, not PayPal/Apple Pay

**Related incidents:**
- Similar issue occurred in staging environment (fixed)
- Payment gateway reported no issues on their end
- Error logs show "Gateway timeout (504)" errors

**Root Cause Summary** (Updated Post-Resolution):

The payment gateway v3.0 introduced a requirement for an `Idempotency-Key` header to prevent duplicate charges. This was documented in their changelog but we missed it during the upgrade review. Without this header, the gateway would timeout waiting for the key.

**Fix**: Added `Idempotency-Key: <UUID>` header to all payment API requests.

**Prevention**:
1. Enhanced code review checklist for external API upgrades
2. Added integration tests that verify all required headers
3. Set up staging environment to test gateway upgrades before production
4. Created alerting for any payment API changes
