# Code Reviewer Skill

## Purpose

This skill provides comprehensive code review guidance covering quality, security, performance, and style. It helps identify issues, suggest improvements, and ensure code meets project standards before committing.

## Activation

**On-demand via command:** `/review-code <file-path>`

Example:
```bash
/review-code src/tools/example/core.py
```

## When to Use

- Self-review before committing
- Refactoring existing code
- Security concerns arise
- Performance optimization needed
- Ensuring style guide compliance
- Code quality improvement
- Pre-pull request review

## Resources

### review-checklist.md
Comprehensive code review checklist covering:
- **Code Quality:** File organization, naming, type hints, docstrings, error handling
- **Testing:** Coverage, quality, edge cases
- **Performance:** Algorithm efficiency, memory usage, I/O optimization
- **Security:** Input validation, authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Style:** PEP 8 compliance, import organization, formatting

### security-patterns.md
Security best practices including:
- **OWASP Top 10:** Injection, authentication, XSS, etc.
- **Python-Specific Security:** eval() usage, pickle security, SQL injection
- **Best Practices:** Input validation patterns, secure authentication, data protection

## Provides

### Code Quality Feedback

### Example 3: Performance Review

```bash
/review-code src/processors/data_processor.py
```

**Analyzes:**

- [ ] Deeply nested code (>3 levels)
- [ ] Long functions (>50 lines)
- [ ] Duplicate code
- [ ] Unclear variable names
- [ ] Missing error handling
- [ ] No input validation

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Commit Review
Use this skill before committing:
```bash
/review-code <file-you-modified>
```

### Pre-Pull Request Review
Review all changed files:
```bash
git diff --name-only main | xargs -I {} /review-code {}
```

### Refactoring Review
After refactoring, verify improvements:
```bash
/review-code <refactored-file>
```

## Notes

- **Guidance Only:** This skill provides review feedback and guidance. It does not automatically fix issues.
- **Comprehensive:** Reviews cover multiple dimensions (quality, security, performance, style).
