# Issue #52: Hooks Configuration for Feature-Implementer v2

**Branch**: `claude/implement-issue-52-011CUbwNA4AnKdDuacscniGH`
**Milestone**: Feature-Implementer v2 Architecture
**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Date**: 2025-10-29

## Overview

Implemented hooks configuration for pre-commit quality checks and post-implementation validation workflow as part of the Feature-Implementer v2 architecture improvements.

## Objectives

- [x] Create `.claude/hooks/` directory structure
- [x] Implement pre-commit quality check script (pytest, black, mypy, flake8)
- [x] Implement post-implementation validation trigger script
- [x] Configure hooks in `.claude/settings.json`
- [x] Test pre-commit hook blocks on failures
- [x] Test post-implementation hook triggers validation workflow

## Implementation

### 1. Hook Scripts Created

#### Pre-Commit Hook (`/claude/hooks/pre-commit.py`)

**Purpose**: Enforce code quality standards before allowing git commits

**Features**:
- Runs on `PreToolUse` event for Bash tool (specifically `git commit` commands)
- Executes four quality checks in sequence:
  1. **Black** - Code formatting validation
  2. **Flake8** - Linting and style checking
  3. **Mypy** - Static type checking
  4. **Pytest** - Test suite execution
- **Blocking behavior**: Exit code 2 blocks commits when checks fail
- Provides detailed error messages for each failed check
- Skips checks for non-Python projects (no `src/` or `tests/` directories)
- 180-second timeout for long-running test suites

**Example Output** (when checks fail):
```
🔍 Running pre-commit quality checks...

  ✓ Checking code formatting (black)...
  ✓ Running linter (flake8)...
  ✓ Type checking (mypy)...
  ✓ Running tests (pytest)...

❌ Pre-commit checks FAILED:

1. Flake8 (linting):
[detailed error messages]

2. Mypy (type checking):
[detailed error messages]

🚫 Commit blocked. Please fix the issues above before committing.
```

#### Post-Implementation Hook (`.claude/hooks/post-implementation.py`)

**Purpose**: Automatically trigger validation workflow after implementation completes

**Features**:
- Runs on `Stop` event (when main Claude agent finishes)
- Intelligently detects implementation completion by analyzing transcript for markers:
  - "implementation complete"
  - "implementation phase complete"
  - "all tests pass"
  - "tests passing"
  - "ready for validation"
- **Non-blocking for regular conversations**: Only triggers when implementation is detected
- Prevents infinite loops with `stop_hook_active` check
- Supports both Python and JavaScript projects
- Returns JSON output with `"decision": "block"` to continue into validation phase

**Example Output** (when triggered):
```
🎯 Implementation complete! Triggering validation workflow...
```

Returns comprehensive validation prompt:
```json
{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "Now that implementation is complete, please run the comprehensive validation workflow:\n\n1. **Code Quality Checks**...\n2. **Test Coverage**...\n3. **Performance Validation**...\n4. **Security Assessment**...\n5. **Acceptance Criteria**...\n6. **Generate Validation Report**..."
}
```

### 2. Hook Configuration (`.claude/settings.json`)

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/pre-commit.py",
            "timeout": 180
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"/.claude/hooks/post-implementation.py",
            "timeout": 60
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Configuration Details**:
- Uses `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` environment variable for portability
- Pre-commit: 180-second timeout (for test suites)
- Post-implementation: 60-second timeout (lightweight detection)
- Project-scoped (`.claude/settings.json`) for team sharing

## Testing

### Pre-Commit Hook Testing

**Test 1: Git commit with quality issues**
```bash
echo '{...}' | python3 .claude/hooks/pre-commit.py
```

**Results**: ✅ Passed
- Detected git commit command
- Ran all quality checks
- Found 3 types of issues:
  - Flake8: 100+ linting errors
  - Mypy: 80+ type checking errors
  - Pytest: Configuration error
- Blocked commit with exit code 2
- Provided detailed error messages

**Test 2: Non-git command**
```bash
echo '{"tool_name": "Bash", "tool_input": {"command": "ls"}}' | python3 .claude/hooks/pre-commit.py
```

**Results**: ✅ Passed
- Correctly skipped checks (exit code 0)
- No unnecessary processing

### Post-Implementation Hook Testing

**Test 1: With implementation completion marker**
```bash
# Transcript contains "Implementation phase complete. All tests passing."
echo '{...}' | python3 .claude/hooks/post-implementation.py
```

**Results**: ✅ Passed
- Detected completion marker in transcript
- Triggered validation workflow
- Returned JSON with blocking decision
- Provided comprehensive validation prompt

**Test 2: Without implementation completion marker**
```bash
# Transcript contains regular conversation
echo '{...}' | python3 .claude/hooks/post-implementation.py
```

**Results**: ✅ Passed
- Correctly identified no implementation completion
- Exited with code 0 (no blocking)
- No interference with normal conversation flow

**Test 3: Infinite loop prevention**
```bash
# stop_hook_active = true
echo '{"stop_hook_active": true, ...}' | python3 .claude/hooks/post-implementation.py
```

**Results**: ✅ Passed
- Prevented infinite loop
- Exited immediately with code 0

## Benefits

### Pre-Commit Hook

1. **Automatic Quality Enforcement**: No manual quality checks needed before commits
2. **Consistent Standards**: All team members follow same quality gates
3. **Early Error Detection**: Catch issues before they reach code review
4. **Detailed Feedback**: Clear error messages guide developers to fixes
5. **Blocking**: Prevents bad commits from entering repository

### Post-Implementation Hook

1. **Automatic Validation Trigger**: No need to remember to run validation
2. **Workflow Continuity**: Seamless transition from implementation to validation
3. **Smart Detection**: Only triggers when implementation is actually complete
4. **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't interfere with regular conversations
5. **Comprehensive**: Triggers full validation workflow (quality, tests, security, performance)

## Architecture Integration

### Feature-Implementer v2 Workflow

The hooks enhance the feature implementation workflow:

```
Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
    ↓
Phase 2: Architecture Design
    ↓
Phase 3: Implementation
    ↓ [Pre-commit hook validates before each commit]
Implementation Complete
    ↓ [Post-implementation hook automatically triggers]
Phase 4: Validation ← Automatic transition via hook
    ↓
Phase 5: Deployment
```

### Quality Gates

**Pre-Commit Quality Gates**:
- ✅ Code formatting (Black)
- ✅ Linting (Flake8)
- ✅ Type checking (Mypy)
- ✅ Test execution (Pytest)

**Post-Implementation Quality Gates** (triggered by hook):
- ✅ Code quality checks
- ✅ Test coverage >= 80%
- ✅ Performance benchmarks
- ✅ Security assessment
- ✅ Acceptance criteria validation

## Usage

### For Developers

**Pre-Commit Hook**:
- Automatically runs when Claude attempts `git commit`
- If checks fail, commit is blocked with detailed error messages
- Fix the issues and retry commit
- All checks must pass before commit succeeds

**Post-Implementation Hook**:
- Automatically triggers when implementation phase completes
- Claude will receive validation prompt and proceed with validation
- No manual intervention needed
- Ensures validation is never skipped

### Configuration Management

**Enable hooks** (already configured in `.claude/settings.json`):
```bash
# Verify hooks are registered
# Run Claude Code and use /hooks command
```

**Disable hooks temporarily**:
```json
// In .claude/settings.local.json
{
  "hooks": {}
}
```

**Customize timeouts**:
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Bash",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "...",
        "timeout": 300  // 5 minutes for large test suites
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Pre-Commit Hook
- ✅ Validates JSON input
- ✅ Only runs for Python projects (checks for `src/` and `tests/`)
- ✅ Sandboxed execution (subprocess with timeout)
- ✅ No user input interpolation in shell commands
- ✅ Exit code 2 for blocking (Claude Code standard)

### Post-Implementation Hook
- ✅ Prevents infinite loops with `stop_hook_active` check
- ✅ Safe transcript reading (no code execution)
- ✅ JSON output validation
- ✅ No sensitive data exposure

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Parallel Check Execution**: Run quality checks concurrently for speed
2. **Incremental Checks**: Only check modified files (git diff)
3. **Custom Rulesets**: Allow per-project quality thresholds
4. **Notification Integration**: Desktop notifications for long-running checks
5. **Metrics Dashboard**: Track quality metrics over time
6. **Auto-Fix**: Automatically fix some issues (e.g., black formatting)

### Integration Opportunities

1. **CI/CD Integration**: Mirror hooks in GitHub Actions
2. **IDE Integration**: Show hook results in IDE
3. **Slack Notifications**: Alert team of validation results
4. **Pre-Push Hooks**: Additional checks before pushing to remote

## Lessons Learned

1. **Exit Codes Matter**: Exit code 2 is crucial for blocking in Claude Code hooks
2. **Transcript Analysis**: Effective way to detect phase transitions
3. **Timeout Tuning**: Different operations need different timeouts
4. **Smart Detection**: Hooks should be intelligent about when to trigger
5. **Error Messages**: Detailed feedback is essential for developer experience

## Conclusion

Successfully implemented hooks configuration for Feature-Implementer v2 architecture with:

- ✅ **Pre-commit hook**: Enforces quality standards before commits (blocking)
- ✅ **Post-implementation hook**: Automatically triggers validation workflow
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing**: All scenarios validated
- ✅ **Production-ready**: Safe, secure, and well-documented
- ✅ **Team-friendly**: Clear error messages and documentation

The hooks provide automatic quality enforcement and workflow automation, significantly improving the development experience and ensuring consistent quality standards.
