# Product Requirements Prompts (PRPs)

This directory contains Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) documents generated during Phase 2 (Design & Planning) of the Feature-Implementer v2 architecture.

## Purpose

PRPs serve as comprehensive implementation guides for Phase 3 (Implementation). Each PRP document contains:

- **Architecture Design**: Component diagrams, data models, API contracts, data flow
- **Library Documentation**: Required libraries with versions, APIs, code examples, best practices
- **Dependencies**: Complete dependency tree with installation instructions and compatibility notes
- **Implementation Plan**: Phased approach with specific tasks, files, and validation checkpoints
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, end-to-end, performance, and security testing approaches
- **Success Criteria**: Acceptance criteria, implementation criteria, testing criteria, quality criteria

## File Naming Convention

PRPs are named using the pattern:
```
feature-{issue-number}-prp.md
```

**Examples**:
- `feature-42-prp.md` - PRP for GitHub issue #42
- `feature-123-prp.md` - PRP for GitHub issue #123

## Directory Structure

```
docs/implementation/prp/
├── README.md                    # This file
├── feature-42-prp.md           # PRP for issue #42
├── feature-43-prp.md           # PRP for issue #43
└── ...                         # Additional PRPs
```

## PRP Generation Process

PRPs are automatically generated by the **Design Orchestrator** agent during Phase 2:

1. **Analysis Review**: Design Orchestrator reads analysis document from Phase 1
2. **Parallel Sub-Agents**: Three sub-agents execute in parallel:
   - **Architecture Designer** (Opus + ultrathink): Designs system architecture
   - **Documentation Researcher** (Haiku + context7): Fetches library documentation
   - **Dependency Manager** (Haiku): Analyzes dependencies and compatibility
3. **Synthesis**: Design Synthesizer skill integrates outputs from all sub-agents
4. **PRP Generation**: PRP Generator skill creates comprehensive PRP document
5. **Output**: PRP saved to this directory

## Using PRPs

PRPs are the primary input for **Phase 3: Implementation**:

1. **Implementation Specialist** reads the PRP for assigned issue
2. Follows the implementation plan phase by phase
3. Uses architecture design, library documentation, and code examples
4. Implements testing strategy as specified
5. Validates against success criteria
6. Marks PRP tasks as complete

## PRP Template

All PRPs follow a standard template defined in:
- `.claude/skills/prp-generator/prp-template.md`

## PRP Examples

Example PRPs for different feature types and complexity levels:
- `.claude/skills/prp-generator/prp-examples.md`

## Related Documentation

- **Analysis Documents**: `docs/implementation/analysis/` - Phase 1 outputs
- **Architecture Documentation**: `docs/architecture/` - Overall architecture design
- **Feature-Implementer v2 Documentation**: `docs/architecture/feature-implementer-v2.md`

## Quality Standards

All PRPs must meet these quality standards:

✅ **Completeness**: All required sections present (architecture, libraries, dependencies, plan, testing, success criteria)
✅ **Actionability**: Implementation guidance is specific and executable
✅ **Traceability**: Design elements link to requirements from analysis
✅ **Consistency**: Terminology, versions, and patterns are consistent throughout
✅ **Validation**: All code examples are valid and tested patterns

## Metrics

Track PRP effectiveness:

- **Completeness Score**: Percentage of required sections completed
- **Implementation Time**: Actual vs. estimated implementation time
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of PRPs that result in successful implementations
- **Quality Score**: Code review feedback and issue resolution time

## Archive

Completed PRPs remain in this directory for reference and learning. They document:
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- Library integration patterns
- Common implementation challenges
- Best practices and lessons learned
