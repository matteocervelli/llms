# Issue #33: Phase 2.2 - Refactor feature-implementer Agent

**Status**: ✅ Completed
**Issue**: [#33](https://github.com/matteocervelli/llms/issues/33)
**Milestone**: Commands→Agents→Skills Architecture
**Implementation Date**: 2025-10-29

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully refactored the monolithic `/feature-implement` command into a streamlined Commands→Agents→Skills architecture, reducing the command from 184 lines to 48 lines (74% reduction) and creating a new `feature-implementer` agent (196 lines) that orchestrates workflow phases while delegating detailed expertise to specialized skills.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Created feature-implementer agent (196 lines) focused on workflow orchestration
- ✅ Simplified feature-implement command (184 → 48 lines, 74% reduction)
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns: orchestration vs expertise
- ✅ Context-based skill activation for automatic invocation
- ✅ Maintains all quality standards and user confirmation checkpoints
- ✅ Reduces token usage via progressive disclosure pattern

---

## Problem Statement

### Before Refactoring

The `/feature-implement` command was a monolithic 184-line file containing:
- Parameter validation
- Detailed workflow instructions for 5 phases
- Security checklists and best practices
- Architecture patterns and design guidance
- Coding standards and testing procedures
- Validation checklists
- Deployment procedures
- Documentation requirements

**Issues**:
1. **Poor separation of concerns**: Command mixed orchestration with detailed expertise
2. **High token usage**: All content loaded upfront regardless of phase
3. **Difficult to maintain**: Changes required editing single large file
4. **Not reusable**: Expertise locked in command, not available to other workflows
5. **Violates Claude Code patterns**: Command should be concise, delegate to agents

### After Refactoring

The architecture now follows Claude Code's recommended hierarchy:

```
User: /feature-implement 33
    ↓
Command (48 lines): Parameter parsing + agent invocation
    ↓
Agent (196 lines): Workflow orchestration + phase coordination
    ↓
Skills (auto-invoked): Detailed expertise loaded on-demand
    ├── analysis skill (4 files, ~1,175 lines)
    ├── design skill (4 files, ~1,569 lines)
    ├── implementation skill (4 files, ~1,779 lines)
    └── validation skill (4 files, ~1,519 lines)
```

**Benefits**:
1. ✅ Clear separation of concerns (orchestration vs expertise)
2. ✅ Progressive disclosure (skills loaded only when needed)
3. ✅ Easier to maintain (modular structure)
4. ✅ Reusable skills (available across workflows)
5. ✅ Follows Claude Code best practices

## Implementation Details

### 1. Feature-Implementer Agent

**File**: `.claude/agents/feature-implementer.md`
**Lines**: 196
**Model**: sonnet (for orchestration)

#### Agent Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: feature-implementer
description: Expert developer for implementing new features from GitHub issues. Use when user requests feature implementation, provides issue number, or says "implement feature". Use PROACTIVELY after GitHub issue is reviewed and needs implementation.
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob
model: sonnet
---
```

**Key Elements**:
- `name`: Lowercase with hyphens (feature-implementer)
- `description`: Natural language with proactive triggers for context matching
- `tools`: All standard tools for orchestration
- `model`: sonnet (appropriate for orchestration logic)

#### Agent Structure

The agent is organized into clear sections:

1. **Role Definition** (12 lines): Expert feature implementer orchestrating complete workflow
2. **Workflow Phases** (134 lines):
   - Phase 1: Requirements Analysis (27 lines)
   - Phase 2: Architecture Design (35 lines) - includes user approval checkpoint
   - Phase 3: Implementation (32 lines)
   - Phase 4: Validation (26 lines)
   - Phase 5: Deployment (14 lines)
3. **Quality Standards** (30 lines): Security, performance, modularity, testing, documentation
4. **Error Handling** (12 lines): Failure documentation, remediation, user guidance
5. **Success Criteria** (8 lines): Acceptance criteria, quality gates, documentation

#### Orchestration Strategy

The agent uses **context-based skill activation**:

```markdown
**Skill Activation**: When you describe the requirements analysis task,
the **analysis skill** will automatically activate to provide systematic
guidance for extracting requirements, evaluating tech stack, analyzing
dependencies, and assessing security considerations.
```

**How it works**:
1. Agent describes what needs to be done (e.g., "analyze requirements")
2. Claude's context matching automatically activates relevant skill
3. Skill provides detailed expertise for that specific task
4. Agent maintains workflow continuity across phases

**No explicit skill invocation required** - skills activate based on context matching.

#### Critical Checkpoints

The agent maintains two critical user confirmation points:

1. **Design Approval** (Phase 2):
   ```markdown
   **CRITICAL CHECKPOINT**:
   - Present the complete design document to the user
   - Explicitly ask: "Should I proceed with implementation based on this design?"
   - **STOP and WAIT** for explicit user approval before proceeding
   ```

2. **Validation** (Phase 4):
   ```markdown
   **Checkpoint**: All quality gates must pass before deployment.
   If validation fails, return to implementation phase to address issues.
   ```

These checkpoints ensure quality control and user oversight at key decision points.

### 2. Simplified Feature-Implement Command

**File**: `.claude/commands/feature-implement.md`
**Lines**: 48 (down from 184, 74% reduction)

#### Command Structure

1. **Frontmatter** (5 lines):
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: Implement new feature from GitHub issue with security-by-design and performance optimization
   allowed-tools: [gh, git, sequential-thinking-mcp, context7-mcp]
   argument-hint: <issue-number> [create-branch:true|false]
   ---
   ```

2. **Plan Mode Tip** (2 lines): Suggests activating Plan Mode for safer workflow

3. **Parameter Validation** (11 lines):
   - Validates issue number is provided
   - Sets default for create-branch flag (true)
   - Provides usage help

4. **Agent Invocation Section** (27 lines):
   - Describes agent's role and 5 phases
   - Lists skills that will be automatically invoked
   - Highlights security, performance, and quality standards
   - Triggers agent invocation via description

5. **Invocation Statement** (1 line):
   ```markdown
   Begin feature implementation for issue #$ISSUE_NUMBER (branch creation: $CREATE_BRANCH).
   ```

#### What Was Removed

All detailed guidance moved to agent and skills:
- ❌ Detailed workflow instructions (now in agent)
- ❌ Sequential-thinking-mcp usage details (now in agent)
- ❌ Tech stack evaluation details (now in analysis skill)
- ❌ Architecture patterns (now in design skill)
- ❌ Security checklists (now in analysis/implementation skills)
- ❌ Performance optimization details (now in implementation skill)
- ❌ Testing procedures (now in implementation/validation skills)
- ❌ Code quality checks (now in validation skill)
- ❌ Documentation requirements (now in agent/skills)
- ❌ Commit message templates (now in agent)
- ❌ PR creation details (now in agent)

#### What Was Kept

Minimal orchestration logic:
- ✅ Parameter validation (command responsibility)
- ✅ Plan Mode suggestion (user experience)
- ✅ High-level workflow overview (transparency)
- ✅ Agent invocation trigger (delegation)

## Technical Architecture

### Context-Based Skill Activation

The refactored architecture uses Claude Code's built-in context matching for skill activation:

```
Agent describes task → Claude matches context → Skill auto-activates
```

**Example Flow**:

1. **Agent says**: "Analyze the issue to extract: feature requirements, acceptance criteria, technical stack requirements, dependencies and integrations, security considerations, performance expectations"

2. **Claude's context matching**: Recognizes this matches the analysis skill's description: "Analyze feature requirements, dependencies, and security considerations"

3. **Analysis skill activates**: Provides systematic guidance, checklists, and scripts

4. **Agent continues**: Maintains workflow state, moves to next phase

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No explicit skill invocation needed
- ✅ Skills loaded only when context matches
- ✅ Progressive disclosure reduces token usage
- ✅ Natural workflow transitions

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern

Content is loaded in three levels:

**Level 1: Command** (48 lines, always loaded)
- Parameter validation
- High-level workflow overview
- Agent invocation

**Level 2: Agent** (196 lines, loaded when invoked)
- Phase orchestration
- Workflow coordination
- Checkpoints and transitions
- Quality standards

**Level 3: Skills** (4 skills × 4 files each, loaded on-demand)
- Detailed expertise by phase
- Checklists and guidelines
- Automation scripts
- Templates and examples

**Token Savings**:
- Command-only: 48 lines always loaded
- Agent: +196 lines when command invoked
- Skills: +~6,000 lines loaded progressively as phases activate
- **Savings**: Only load content when actually needed for current phase

## Testing and Validation

### Manual Testing Workflow

The refactored implementation was tested with the following approach:

1. **Syntax Validation**:
   - ✅ Agent frontmatter valid YAML
   - ✅ Command frontmatter valid YAML
   - ✅ Markdown formatting correct
   - ✅ File paths correct

2. **Structure Validation**:
   - ✅ Agent < 200 lines (actual: 196)
   - ✅ Command < 50 lines (actual: 48)
   - ✅ 5 phases clearly defined
   - ✅ Checkpoints preserved
   - ✅ Quality standards documented

3. **Content Validation**:
   - ✅ No duplication between command/agent/skills
   - ✅ Orchestration logic in agent
   - ✅ Detailed expertise in skills
   - ✅ Context triggers clear for skill activation
   - ✅ User confirmation points preserved

4. **Integration Validation**:
   - ✅ Skills exist in correct locations
   - ✅ Skill descriptions enable context matching
   - ✅ Agent references align with skill capabilities
   - ✅ Workflow continuity maintained

### Functional Testing Plan

To validate the refactored workflow in production:

1. **Create test issue**: Simple feature (e.g., "Add health check endpoint")
2. **Run command**: `/feature-implement <test-issue>`
3. **Verify phases**:
   - Analysis: Requirements extracted, tech stack identified
   - Design: Architecture document created, user approval requested
   - Implementation: TDD workflow followed, tests created
   - Validation: Quality gates passed
   - Deployment: PR created with proper documentation
4. **Verify skills**: Check that skills were automatically invoked (review conversation for skill activations)
5. **Compare output**: Ensure quality matches or exceeds previous implementation

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

1. **Context-Based Activation**: Skills automatically activate without explicit invocation, creating natural workflow
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Loading content on-demand significantly reduces token usage
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Command/Agent/Skills separation makes responsibilities obvious
4. **Preservation of Quality**: All checkpoints, standards, and user confirmations maintained
5. **Modular Structure**: Each component focused on single responsibility

### Challenges Encountered

1. **Balancing Orchestration vs Expertise**: Initial agent draft included too much detail; refined to pure orchestration
2. **Context Trigger Language**: Skill descriptions required careful wording to enable reliable context matching
3. **Workflow Continuity**: Ensuring phase transitions maintain state across skill activations
4. **Documentation Scope**: Determining what goes in agent vs skills vs command

### Best Practices Identified

1. **Agent Description**: Use natural language with explicit triggers ("Use when...", "Use PROACTIVELY when...")
2. **Phase Structure**: Clear phases with objectives, actions, skill activation notes, outputs, checkpoints
3. **Quality Standards**: Document standards once in agent, reference in skills for specifics
4. **User Confirmations**: Keep critical checkpoints in agent (design approval, validation)
5. **Skill References**: Agent describes tasks naturally; skills activate via context matching
