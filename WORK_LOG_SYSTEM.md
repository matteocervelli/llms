# Centralized Work Log System

## Overview

A centralized work logging and reporting system that aggregates work activities from multiple sources (health tracking, email, code commits, meetings, etc.) to create unified work logs. These logs can be shared at multiple organizational levels: individual daily logs, team updates, manager reports, and company-wide newsletters.

## Problem Statement

Knowledge workers struggle with:
- **Fragmented work records**: Work happens across multiple tools (email, Slack, GitHub, task trackers)
- **Status update overhead**: Managers repeatedly ask "what did you work on?"
- **Lost context**: No centralized record of daily accomplishments
- **Inefficient reporting**: Manual compilation of weekly/monthly reports
- **Misalignment**: Teams unaware of what others are working on
- **Onboarding gaps**: New team members can't see historical work patterns

## Solution

A centralized work log system that:

1. **Aggregates** work from multiple sources automatically
2. **Generates** daily, weekly, and monthly summaries
3. **Shares** at appropriate levels (individual, team, company)
4. **Integrates** with existing workflows (1-on-1s, newsletters, reports)
5. **Preserves** institutional knowledge and work history

## Use Cases

### Level 1: Individual Daily Log

```python
# Example structure
class DataCollector:
    """Base class for all data source collectors"""

    def collect(self, date_range: DateRange) -> List[WorkActivity]:
        """Collect work activities from data source"""
        pass

    def categorize(self, activity: WorkActivity) -> ActivityType:
        """Categorize the type of work activity"""
        pass

class GitHubCollector(DataCollector):
    """Collects commits, PRs, issues, reviews from GitHub"""
    pass

```

#### 3. Privacy & Filtering
```python
class PrivacyFilter:
    """Filter sensitive information based on sharing level"""

    def filter_for_level(self, log: WorkLog, level: SharingLevel) -> WorkLog:
        """Apply privacy filters based on sharing level"""
        # Individual: Show everything
